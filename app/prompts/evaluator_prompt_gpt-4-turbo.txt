--- CRITICAL EVALUATION INSTRUCTIONS ---
1. CHECK EVERY REQUIRED TAG - Missing tags automatically reduce structure_compliance
2. COUNT CHARACTERS - Title >60 or meta >155 chars = automatic deduction
3. VERIFY IDs AND CLASSES - Missing id="description", id="key-features", id="neighborhood", class="call-to-action" = deductions
4. ASSESS CONTENT QUALITY - Generic, vague, or poorly written content = lower scores
5. BE STRICT - Most real-world content has issues. Don't give perfect scores easily.
6. LOOK FOR SPECIFIC PROBLEMS - Empty sections, missing content, formatting issues

--- SCORING FORMULA ---
total_score = FLOOR((structure_compliance + language_fluency_seo + multilingual_adaptability) / 3)
